      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a musician and have been one for 16 years. My instrument of choice is the guitar, but I can play piano,
        drums, mandolin and whatever instrument I need to play to get the job done!
      </p>
      <p>
        I first started building websites about 6 years ago after my dad suggested I look into a coding bootcamp
        called the Arkansas Coding Academy. I went ahead and paid the money to attend and I loved it from the start.
        The program was a 6-month course focusing on C#/SQL Web Development. By the end of the class we were very
        proficient in building fully funcitonal web apps using the ASP.Net framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a lot of work trying to get a job in the industry I finally got my break with a company called
        Merkle, Inc. I started as an intern before finally being hired on in a full position as a DevOps Developer.
        Sadly, after the events of 2020 and COVID-19 I was laid off from Merkle, Inc. After that I decided to
        focus on creating music and focusing on learning about the Bible and returning to university. Now, I am
        looking to make my way back into the tech field as a web developer.

      <h2>My projects</h2>
      <p>
        As a freelance web developer, I have built websites for small businesses to help establish their online
        presence. I have built a photography website, a website for a hauling company, and a website for a
        non-profit Christian ministry. I also have built a portfolio website to showcase these projects.
      </p>
      <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
      <p>
        I made the Dean's List at my university, Evangel University in Springfield, MO, and have held a 4.0 GPA.
