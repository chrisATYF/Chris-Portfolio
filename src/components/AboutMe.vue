    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a web developer and a musician. I've been developing websites for about 6 years and I've been playing
        guitar for 16 years. My instrument of choice is the guitar, but I can play piano, drums, mandolin and
        whatever instrument I need to play to get the job done!

        I first started building websites about 6 years ago after my dad suggested I look into a coding bootcamp
        called the Arkansas Coding Academy. I went ahead and paid the money to attend and I loved it from the start.
        The program was a 6-month course focusing on C#/SQL Web Development. By the end of the class we were very
        proficient in building fully funcitonal web apps using the ASP.Net framework.

        After a lot of work trying to get a job in the industry I finally got my break with a company called
        Merkle, Inc. I started as an intern before finally being hired on in a full position as a DevOps Developer.
        Sadly, after the events of 2020 and COVID-19 I was laid off from Merkle, Inc. After that I decided to
        focus on creating music and focusing on learning about the Bible and returning to university. Now, I am
        looking to make my way back into the tech field as a web developer.
