    <h2>My projects</h2>
    <p>
        As a freelance web developer, I have built websites for small businesses to help establish their online
        presence. I have built a photography website, a website for a hauling company, and a website for a
        non-profit Christian ministry. I also have built a portfolio website to showcase these projects.
